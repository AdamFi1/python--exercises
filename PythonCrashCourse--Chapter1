#This file contains my solutions to every exercise listed in Chapter 1 of "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. In addition to the exercise solutions, this file also contains
several of my own examples to illustrate various (simple) concepts that are introduced throughout the chapter. The "Python Exercises" repository will have similar files for each
chapter in the book.
